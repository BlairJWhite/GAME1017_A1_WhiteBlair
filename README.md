Fundamentals II Assignment I
Notes: 
Buttons are recycled, "PLAY" = return to main menu - when on the win/lose states.
                      "Exit" = return to main menu - when paused.
                    
Music sting added to lose.
Music toggle added to win.
SFX jump added to room change event.
SFX laser added to item pick up.
TODO: add sfx for final object, and possibly Text. 
I think my game progression has a slight difference (the final tile is actually just an item you collide with) But I think it achieves the same result. 

Was a tough assignment, but I learned a lot and if I restarted this assignment it would be way better and done in a fraction of the time.
